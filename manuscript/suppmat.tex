\section{Details on the implementation of the DE analysis methods}
For edgeR, analyses were performed with and without empirical Bayes (EB) shrinkage.
In the first analysis, an abundance-dependent trend was fitted to the NB dispersions, 
    and the trended NB dispersion was used to fit a generalized linear model (GLM) for each gene \cite{mccarthy2012differential}.
The GLM deviance was used to estimate the quasi-likelihood (QL) dispersion for each gene, 
    which was stabilized by robust EB shrinkage towards another mean-dispersion trend \cite{lund2012detecting}.
DE testing between groups was performed using the QL F-test.
In the second analysis, the NB dispersion was estimated for each gene individually.
This was used directly to fit the GLM for each gene, and DE testing was performed using the likelihood ratio test (LRT).

For voom, counts were converted to log-CPMs and precision weights were computed from a fitted mean-variance trend.
Log-CPMs and weights for each gene were used to fit a linear model.
Variances were stabilized by EB shrinkage, and genes were tested for DE between groups using a moderated $t$-test.
This analysis was also repeated after using the duplicateCorrelation function to estimate the correlations introduced by the plate effects.
For each gene, this correlation refers to the strength of the association between the count for each cell and the plate of origin.
The consensus correlation across all genes was incorporated into the linear model by blocking on the plate of origin.
DE testing was then repeated on this refitted model.

For DESeq2, the NB dispersion was estimated for each gene and a mean-dispersion trend was fitted across genes.
A normal prior was applied to the log-dispersions for all genes, and the maximum \textit{a posteriori} estimate of the NB disperison was obtained for each gene.
The estimated dispersion was used to fit a GLM to the counts for each gene.
Finally, DE testing was performed between groups using the Wald test.

For edgeR and voom, normalization was performed prior to modelling using the trimmed mean of M-values (TMM) method \cite{robinson2010scaling}.
For DESeq2, normalization was performed using size factors.
This step is not strictly necessary in this simulation, given that library-specific biases have not been introduced and all cells have the same library size.
Nonetheless, normalization is included as part of the standard analysis.

For monocle, counts were transformed into CPM values that were considered to be roughly log-normal.
These were used for DE testing between groups with the LRT in the differentialGeneTest function.

For MAST, counts were log-transformed after adding a prior count of 1.
All libraries were of the same size, and all genes were of the same length, 
    so the log-counts are effectively equivalent to the log-transcripts per million used in the original description of the algorithm \cite{finak2015mast}.
A hurdle model was fitted to the log-counts using the biological group as the factor of interest and the number of non-zero counts in each library as a covariate.
The fitting method was set to ``bayesglm'' and empirical Bayes shrinkage was turned on with the ``MLE'' method and the ``H1'' model.
DE genes between groups were identified using the LRT.

        Simulation scenarios with different number of cells per plate and different library sizes per cell.
        Each scenario is represented by two plates where the set-up for each plate is used for all plates in group $g_1$ or $g_2$.
        Scenario 1 contains different numbers of cells, while scenarios 2 to 4 contain plates with different library sizes between cells.
        The library size of each cell is indicated by the colour of the well.

    Expression profiles of DE genes between 2i and serum (top) or between a2i and serum conditions (bottom) in the mESC data set, 
        for the top genes detected by QL edgeR on summed counts.
    Each plot contains the expression profile for one gene, where the $y$-axis represents the log-CPMs.
    Each point represents a cell in the serum (black) or a2i/2i conditions (grey).
    A prior of 0.25 was added to each count to avoid undefined log-CPMs from zeroes.
    For simplicity, only cells in one batch are shown for both contrasts.
